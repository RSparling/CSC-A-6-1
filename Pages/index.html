        <p>
          And welcome to a slice of the things that I've made. I'm Russell,
          though many of my games are signed as "MoonCat". As you can probably
          guess by the title I mostly work on games, animations and other
          interactive media. I've been doing it on and off for over a decade now
          and I've learned alot in that time. This website is a showcase of some
          of the things I've made and a place to keep up with what I'm doing
          now. Enjoy!
        </p>

          Bellow is one of my latest projects, a 3d raycasting engine made in
          SDL2 and C++. It was alot of hardwork but I like how it turned out.

        <h3>Unreal Engine Game: The Wall</h3>
        <p>
          This is a game I made in Unreal Engine 5. It's a simple defence game
          in which you start off only being able to throw rocks and hire and
          better defenders as time goes on.

        <h3>Raycasting RPG Built in WinForms</h3>
        <p>
          This is a game that is made in C# within WinForms and was my first
          rudemninatry attempt at building a raycast game. While it relies
          heavily on the functionality provided by WinForms this was the
          foundation of what become by own personal raycast engine. Unlike the
          SSD2 raycast engine which was built from scratch, this one includes
          gameplay and functionality that wasnt included in the standalone.
