        <p>Hi, my name is Russell. I've been doing programming and hobbyist game development for over 7 years now. For a while it was a thing that I could only devote a little time to however now it's my mission to build the skills I need to become a pro. This website is proof of my journey, my achievements and my progress from just another amateur to an industry professional.</p>
